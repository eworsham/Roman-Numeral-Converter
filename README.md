# Roman Numeral Converter

This program is designed to convert roman numerals to its equivalent modern number and vice versa.

No addition software, files, or external libraries are required to run this program. Simply download the files, or clone the repository, then open the file index.html in your browser of choice.

I incorporated some error checking, however there are still some inputs I am aware of that result in undesired outputs at this time, such as entering VVVV when converting from roman numerals to modern numbers. The output says that VVVV is equal to 20, however VVVV is not a real roman numeral.

Thanks for taking a look at this, I hope you enjoy it!
