# Roman-Numeral-Converter

This program is designed to convert roman numerals to it's equivalent modern number and vice versa.

No addition software, files, or external libraries are required to run this program. Simply download the files, or clone the repository, then open the file index.html in your browser of choice.

I spent the full 4 hours working on the program. The program works to convert from roman numerals to modern numbers as well as from modern numbers to roman numerals. I was short on time when writing the function to convert from modern numbers to roman numerals, so that function is messier than I would have hoped for. I would have found a simpler more efficient solution if I had more time.

I also would have spent more time on error checking had I had more time. I incorporated some error checking, however there are still some inputs I am aware of that result in undesired outputs, such as entering VVVV when converting from roman numerals to modern numbers. The output says that VVVV is equal to 20, however VVVV is not a real roman numeral.

Thanks for taking a look at this, I hope you enjoy it!
